# HW02-B

**This is a submission of Homework for Week 2 Part B.**

Variation of the previous artwork the Artwork by **Vera Molnár** replicated by Nikhil

This repository contains a p5.js sketch that generates a centered grid pattern of colored squares on the canvas' replicated version.

Canvas Setup: The canvas is set to the full browser window size with a beige background (rgb(236, 209, 161)), ensuring that the design is responsive to the screen size.

Grid Layout: The design features a 4x4 grid of squares, with each square sized at 50x50 pixels, separated by a 10-pixel padding. The grid is centered on the canvas by calculating startX and startY based on the canvas and grid dimensions.

Random Rotation: Each square is rotated by a random degree between 0 and 360, using the rotate() function within a push() and pop() block to isolate transformations. The rectMode(CENTER) ensures the squares are centered on their transformation origin.

Color Scheme: The squares are filled with various shades of blue, teal, and brown, providing contrast and creating a dynamic, randomized look with the random rotations.
